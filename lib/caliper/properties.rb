# Module allowing Caliper classes to declare properties.
#
# The 'caliper_property' class method declares a property name and optional default value on a class. The default value
# will be set to nil if not specified. Properties and default values are inherited by subclasses.
#
# On object initialization, an instance variable with accessors is created for each property. Property values may be
# specified through an options hash; any properties not specified will be set to the class-declared defaults.
#
module Caliper
  module Properties

    # During object initialization, set properties from the options hash, falling back to class-defined defaults
    # when not specified.
    def initialize_properties(opts)
      self.class.properties.each do |prop_key, prop_attributes|
        value = opts.has_key?(prop_key) ? opts[prop_key] : self.class.safe_dup(prop_attributes[:default])
        send "#{prop_key}=", value
      end
    end

    # Return property names and values as a hash.
    def properties
      self.class.properties.each_key.with_object({}) do |key, props|
        props[key] = send(key)
