# Module allowing Caliper classes to declare contexts.
#
# The 'caliper_context' class method declares a context for a class. Contexts are inherited by subclasses.
#
# On object initialization, an instance variable with accessors is created for the context, and set to the class-
# declared value unless otherwise specified in the options hash.
#
module Caliper
  module Contexts

    CONTEXT = 'http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1'
    CONTEXTS = [CONTEXT]

    attr_accessor :context

    # During object initialization, set context from the options hash, falling back to the class-defined default
    # when not specified.
    def initialize_context(opts)
      @context = opts.has_key?(:context) ? opts[:context] : self.class.context
    end

      # inheritance behavior.
